# TTS_GTK
Graphical interface for Coqui TTS (Text to Speech) command line. Made in GTK3 and Python3 for the Linux platform.

This program uses the [Coqui TTS](https://github.com/coqui-ai/TTS) software for converting text to speech. This is a very interesting project and is constantly updated and improving fast. But it still has some limitations. You can use it from command line or install it as a server. I decided to add a third option: A GTK3 graphical interface. I also added support and use of all the cpu cores you have, the text will be processed in the background while the first sentence will be soon to hear as an audio clip.
